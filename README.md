The voting system for animesociety for form submissions and nominations

Instructions for use:
1. Gather nominations using the pre-existing nominations form already used by the society.
2. Download the responses as an CSV file. not the name must be "AnimeSoc Termly Anime Nomination Form (Responses) - Form responses 1.csv", 
   this should be it by default so you won't need to rename the file if the nominations form name was not changed. Though check to make sure the file name
   is correct.
