The voting system for animesociety for form submissions and nominations
You might want to download this folder.
When running, if authorisation permissions are needed, just click advanced and continue in the browser. Google will send you an email about the activity.

Instructions for use:
1. Gather nominations using the pre-existing nominations form already used by the society.
2. Download the responses as an CSV file. note the name must be "AnimeSoc Termly Anime Nomination Form (Responses) - Form responses 1.csv", 
   this should be it by default so you won't need to rename the file if the nominations form name was not changed. Though check to make sure the file name
   is correct.
3. Run the python script in a folder, with the "AnimeSoc Termly Anime Nomination Form (Responses) - Form responses 1.csv", called "submissions" and the script will create 3 new      3 new CSV files called "Slot A","Slot B","Slot C". Save these on the google drive as a Google Sheet file. 
4. Open the CSV files on the drive now as a Google Sheet file. On the top bar go to Tools > Script Editor and copy-paste the "Slot Voting Generator.js" into that script editor and    run the function.
5. Now 3 Google Forms have been created for the round voting, this can be used again for round 2 by just editing the slot sheets and removing eliminated rows.
6. Check the Google Sheet is correct, make any changes necessary such as changing the font, theme, colours and header image. Or change the response/submit/closed message, you may    customise the form as you see fit ^_^
